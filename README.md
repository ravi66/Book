## Book

### An application for recording transactions written in Blazor WebAssembly

#### What Book is:
Book is a project I'm mainly using as a learning experience in various technologies new to me:
- [Blazor WebAssembly](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
- PWA ([Progressive Web Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application))
- [EF Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) backed by a SQLite
 database, _in the browser cache_, with the help of
 [SqliteWasmHelper](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/SqliteWasmHelper)
- [MudBlazor](https://www.mudblazor.com/) components and UI styling

It is a web application that has no back-end services - everything is accomplished ocally in 
the browser.
